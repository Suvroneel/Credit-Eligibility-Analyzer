# UI

Minimal web interface to upload CSVs.

## Files
- `index.html` — upload page
- `upload.js` — JS logic to request presigned URL and PUT CSV
- `README.md` — this file

## Usage
1. Open `index.html` in a browser
2. Choose CSV file and click Upload
3. Make sure `presignEndpoint` points to your deployed presign Lambda
